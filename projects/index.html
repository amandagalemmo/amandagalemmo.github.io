					<h3>Minesweeper is a Roguelike</h3>
				</a>
				<p>
					Born from the idea that Minesweeper fits the definition of a roguelike as laid out in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, I created a simple dungeon-crawler-esque verison of Minesweeper where you are just some little guy in a procedurally-generated world. Currently in progress, with some visual bugs that need to be ironed out + some feature additions planned for the future. <a href="/minesweeper/index.html" target="_blank">Play it here</a>!

					<h3>Tuesday Night Project - A Hug Vibes Care Package</h3>
				</a>
				<p>
					I am the current website maintainer for Tuesday Night Project, an Asian American grassroots and volunteer-based organization fiercely devoted to bridging communities by providing programming and interactive spaces for people to connect through artistic expression and strong, creative, community partnerships. As a fun way to connect with our community during COVID, the team created the "Hug Vibes Care Package", a shipped box with various items relating to Little Tokyo and the TNP community. I designed and programmed in collaboration the landing page for the project, linked above.
